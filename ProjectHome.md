An experimental pure Python library for manipulating and working with [N-triples](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ntriples/) formatted files. The library implements an in-memory RDF triple store with a simplified API for pattern matching. A command line interface to the library provides data aggregation and statistics performed on raw N-triples files. When "py\_triple\_simple.py" is run with [PyPy](http://pypy.org) triples have been observed moving at the rate of 30e3/second - 70e3/second.  For large RDF databases, consisting of 10 million or more triples, a large memory machine (8 GB of RAM) is required.
